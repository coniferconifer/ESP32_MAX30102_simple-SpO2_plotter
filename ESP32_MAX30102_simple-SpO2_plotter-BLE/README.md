# Simple SpO2 plotter for MH-ET LIVE MAX30102 with BLE

Using Sparkfun MAX3010X library https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX3010x_Sensor_Library SpO2 is calulated from square root means of all raw data at 50Hz sampling speed, providing stable SpO2 values and shows SpO2 and the user's heart beat at the same time on Arduino's serial plotter.

This program sends SpO2 as a HRM(Heart Rate Monitor) of BLE standart service and smartphone application such as nRF Toolbox for BLE can display SpO2 as if it is a Heat Rate Monitor.

When 93bpm is displayed , it is 93% SpO2. not a Heart Rate!

Fig.1 SpO2 is displayed as HRM on nRF Toolbox for BLE
![Fig.1 SpO2 as HRM](BLE-SpO2.png)

Shows SpO2(%) , Heart Rate(bpm) the user's heart beat by IR and RED LED on Arduino's serial plotter.
works with Sparkfun MAX3010X library

- No display hardware is required.
- This program does not need large 32bit buffer, calculates SpO2 on the fly. (no SpO2 data from the sparkfun's library)
- This program should not be used for medical purposes !
- I wrote this to learn how SpO2 can be measured and pay tributes for the inventors.


## What's new
- Sparkfun's MAX30105 board is supported, use #define MAX30105
- Heart Rate monitor is displayed on Arduino IDE's serial plotter.
- https://youtu.be/NfxGxCVRop4
- 320x240 ILI9341 TFT touch screen display can be used by #define TFT_DISPLAY and #define DEEPSLEEP
  https://youtu.be/i-jY47I-rwI 

Optional hardwares if you like
- LED indicator on GPIO_15 , LED connected to GPIO_15 via pull down resister.(3.3kOhm for ex.)
- BEEP piezo speaker on GPIO_12
- if GPIO_4 is connected to ground, Heart rate will be sent to BLE/HRM.  
- 320x240 ILI9341 TFT touch screen display via SPI with TFT_eSPI library
  https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
  
Use #define TFT_DISPLAY and #define DEEPSLEEP for ILI9341 320x240 display with XPT2046 touch screen controller
```
            
-TFT_MISO = GPIO_NUM_19
-TFT_MOSI = GPIO_NUM_23
-TFT_SCLK = GPIO_NUM_18
-TFT_CS  = GPIO_NUM_5  // Chip select control pin
-TFT_DC  = GPIO_NUM_17 // Data Command control pin
-TFT_RST = GPIO_NUM_16 // Reset pin (could connect to RST pin)
-TFT_LCD = GPIO_NUM_32 // LCD on off
-TOUCH_CS = GPIO_NUM_2 // for future use
-TOUCH_DIN = GPIO_NUM_23 // for future use
-TOUCH_DO = GPIO_NUM_19  // for future use
-TOUCH_IRQ = GPIO_NUM_33 // used to power on and sleep
 if you are to use ILI9341 display without touch screen sensor , use a push button connected to GPIO33 and GND.
```
When this program is running , touch the screen to go to sleep mode. 
When finger is not on the sensor for 30sec, ESP32 will go to sleep mode.
It is possible to wakeup ESP32 by touching the screen.



## Tips:
- Used argorithm

  DC component of IR and RED data (average) is calculated by digital low pass filter and subtracted from raw data to get AC components.
  Then, square root means of AC component of RED and IR are calculated for every 100 samples.

  SpO2 is calculated as 
```  
  R=((square root means of RED/ RED average )/((square root means of IR)/IR average)) 
  
  SpO2 = -23.3 * (R - 0.4) + 100
```  
The last formula is read from the graph in https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/00001525B.pdf
or https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/jp/AppNotes/00001525B_JP.pdf
  


- when IR signal is smaller than 30000 (#define FINGER_ON 30000), then SpO2 becomes 80 to indicate your finger is not on the sensor.

- Since MH-ET LIVE MAX30102 breakout board seems outputting IR and RED swapped when Sparkfun's library is used.
```C
red = particleSensor.getFIFOIR();
ir = particleSensor.getFIFORed();
```
  is used in my code. If you have Sparkfun's MAX30105 breakout board , try #define MAX30105
  (uncomment //#define MAX30105 )
